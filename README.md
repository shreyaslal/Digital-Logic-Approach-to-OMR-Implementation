# Digital-Logic-Approach-to-OMR-Implementation
The project implements an OMR machine for the Design of Digital Systems (CS201) course, leveraging digital logic circuits. It incorporates components such as flip-flops, multiplexers, counters, and LDRs to scan, store, and compare MCQ answers from OMR sheets, enabling real-time evaluation and results.
